I am a first-year MSCS student at University of Southern California, now working as a research intern in [INK Lab @ USC](https://inklab.usc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiang Ren](https://www.seanre.com/) and Postdoc. [Siyuan Wang](https://siyuanwangw.github.io/). My current research focuses on RLHF, Test-time Computing and Reasoning of Large Language Models.

I achieved my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Shanghai University. During that time, I conducted in-depth research on Inference Acceleration, High Performance Computing, In-vehicle System Security and Super-Resolution.

If you have any inquiries or are interested in collaboration, please feel free to contact me via email at jamesnulliu@gmail.com.
